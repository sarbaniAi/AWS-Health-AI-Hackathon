Steps to test

Run the notebooks in order datasets are present in datset zip folder. Place the input files (as mentioned below) in the same folder as notebook and run all cells.

Notebook -1 : "1-model-trained-with-tabular-labitems-only.ipynb" :  The input file is "lab_items_v01.csv"

Notebook-2: "2-AWSMedicalComprehend-extract-diagnosis-from-DischargeSummary.ipynb" : Input files are "lab_items_v01.csv" & "noteevents_hf_v01.csv". Output is "extract_df.csv". 
But we will not recommend to run it again. Our AWS Account charged 4000 dollar to extract this "extract_df.csv" from "noteevents_hf_v01.csv" using AWS Comprehend Medical. 
Hence recomeding DO NOT run Notebook-2, use "extract_df.csv" as input  Nootebook-3 directly.


Notebook -3: "3-Cluster-DiagnosisNames-from-DischargeSummary-TopicModelling.ipynb" : Input file "extract_df.csv". Output "dxcode-cluster.csv".

Notebook-4: "4-AWSComprehendMedicalExtract+TabularItems-Train-Predict.ipynb" : Input files are "dxcode-cluster.csv" , "lab_items_v01.csv", "noteevents_hf_v01.csv"
Output - Model results.
